            In Gem Grab, two teams of three players each strive to collect the highest number of Gems possible. Once a team accumulates more than ten Gems, a countdown of 15 seconds begins. If the team maintains their ten-plus Gem count throughout the 15 seconds, they clinch victory. However, if the Gem count dips below ten, the countdown halts. If both teams exceed ten gems simultaneously, the timer activates for the team with the highest number of gems. A Gem spawns at the map's center every seven seconds. Players can carry an unlimited number of Gems. However, being eliminated results in the loss of all Gems in possession, which enemies and/or teammates are able to collect.

            In Bounty, two teams of three have the objective to collect as many stars as possible. The team with the most stars by the end of the timer will win the match. At the beginning of every match, all brawlers start with a two star bounty. For each elimination they get, a new star is added to their bounty. If they are killed, they will automatically respawn with the two star bounty. In each match there is a blue star present at the center of the map, essentially made as a tiebreaker if the teams have the same amount of stars.

            In Brawl Ball, two teams of three brawlers try score goals by shooting the ball into your opposing team's net. The first to score two goals wins the match. The ball will spawn at the center of the map. Once a Brawler picks up the ball, it will not be able to use your regular attacks, Super, or Gadgets. The shoot button will instead shoot the ball in the preferred direction and using the Super will deliver a more powerful shot of the ball. A key thing to note is that if the ball carrier is knocked back, defeated, or stunned, they will drop the ball on the spot. If the timer ends and both teams are still tied on the same score, the game will enter a sudden death mode where all obstacles and decor are removed from the map. In this case, the first team to score wins the match.

            In Hot Zone, two teams of three brawlers each have to capture all of the Hot Zone(s). Brawlers can capture Hot Zones by standing within the Zones' radius. A capture percentage bar will be shown above in the corner of the screen to show each team's overall progress in capturing the Zones. Only Brawlers are able to capture zones, so pets, turrets, or any non-brawler item won't be able to capture the zone for them If no team fully captures all the Hot Zones by the end of the match timer, the team with the highest capture percentage wins the game.

            In Showdown, ten players individually battle in a battle-royale style match. Only one single round is present, and there is no respawning. Power Cube boxes are scattered across the map. Destroying them will drop Power Cubes, giving them health, damage and regen boosts. In Solo Showdown, the last brawler standing wins the match. In Duo Showdown, the ten brawlers are split into five duos, with the last team standing winning the match. If a team member is eliminated, they can respawn after fifteen seconds only if the other teammate stays alive. If the remaining teammate is eliminated, then the team loses the match. Picking up a Power Cube will contribute to both teammates' overral Power Cube count.
